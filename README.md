## Description

Popular Github repository app.

- To search a repository please include owner and repository name, example: facebook/react
- Because a repository could have many authors, the owner is displayed as the author.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test:unit
```

## Future Improvements

I would like to improve the UI to accomodate for displaying nice errors instead of just alert
